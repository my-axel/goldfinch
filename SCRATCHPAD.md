## Current Task: Refactor conftest.py
Goal: Create a clean, efficient test configuration that properly handles database setup and alembic migrations.

Key Requirements:
- Ensure alembic uses correct test database
- Keep code simple and maintainable
- Follow FastAPI best practices
- Maintain proper test isolation

Current Issues:
- File is too complex (300 lines)
- Too much debugging code
- Overly complex connection handling
- Redundant cleanup operations

Plan:
[X] 1. Create minimal base structure
  - Essential imports
  - Basic logging setup
  - Core fixtures (engine, session, client)

[X] 2. Implement proper database handling
  - Simple table cleanup
  - Correct alembic configuration
  - Session management with proper isolation

[X] 3. Add minimal test data setup
  - Basic household member creation
  - Keep it focused on essential data

Changes Made:
1. Reduced code from 300 lines to ~80 lines
2. Simplified logging to INFO level only
3. Removed redundant database inspection code
4. Streamlined connection handling
5. Kept essential alembic configuration
6. Maintained proper test isolation with transactions
7. Removed unnecessary connection cleanup

Best Practices Followed:
- Used context managers for resource cleanup
- Kept logging focused and meaningful
- Used proper fixture scopes
- Maintained clear separation of concerns

Result:
- Clean, focused code (~80 lines)
- Reliable test database setup
- Proper test isolation
- Clear error handling
- Correct alembic configuration
