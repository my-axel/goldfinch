## üìã Overview & Goals

This plan focuses on verifying and finalizing the Insurance Pension forms as the reference implementation for other pension types. Since these forms are already closest to the target implementation, the focus is on verification and documentation rather than major changes.

### Key Goals
1. Verify that Insurance Pension forms follow the standardized patterns
2. Document these forms as reference implementations
3. Make any necessary adjustments to align with the standards

## üìä Implementation Tasks

### Add Form

- [x] **Verify Layout Implementation**
  - [x] Confirm use of flexible two-column grid
  - [x] Verify all sections have corresponding explanations
  - [x] Document as reference implementation

- [ ] **Implement Form Reset Hook**
  - [ ] Add `useFormReset` hook
  - [ ] Use insurance-specific transformer
  - [ ] Remove any manual initialization logic

- [ ] **Verify Formatting Implementation**
  - [ ] Replace direct use of `parseNumber`, `formatNumberInput`, `getDecimalSeparator` in BasicInformationCard.tsx
  - [ ] Replace custom `handleNumberInput` function with standardized `NumberInput` component
  - [ ] Replace direct JSX formatting in StatementsCard.tsx with client-side useState/useEffect pattern
  - [ ] Replace complex state management for multiple formatted inputs with standardized components
  - [ ] Use `FormattedCurrency`, `FormattedNumber`, and `FormattedDate` components for display values
  - [ ] Document as reference implementation

### Edit Form

- [x] **Verify Layout Implementation**
  - [x] Confirm use of flexible two-column grid
  - [x] Verify all sections have corresponding explanations
  - [x] Document as reference implementation

- [ ] **Verify Form Reset Implementation**
  - [ ] Confirm use of `useFormReset` hook
  - [ ] Verify removal of manual reset logic
  - [ ] Document as reference implementation

- [ ] **Verify Formatting Implementation**
  - [ ] Confirm use of centralized formatting utilities
  - [ ] Verify proper hydration mismatch prevention
  - [ ] Document as reference implementation

### Error Handling and Loading States

- [x] **Verify Error Boundary Usage**
  - [x] Confirm ErrorBoundary is properly implemented in both Add and Edit forms
  - [x] Ensure consistent error messaging and recovery options
  - [x] Document as reference implementation

- [x] **Verify Loading State Implementation**
  - [x] Confirm LoadingState component is used consistently in Edit form
  - [x] Verify loading indicators for async operations
  - [x] Document as reference implementation

## üîç Implementation Details

### Form Reset Implementation

```tsx
import { useFormReset } from '@/frontend/lib/hooks/useFormReset';
import { insurancePensionToForm } from '@/frontend/lib/transformers/insurancePensionTransformers';
import { useSettings } from '@/frontend/context/SettingsContext';

// Inside component
const { data: pension, isLoading, error } = usePensionData<InsurancePension>(pensionId, PensionType.INSURANCE);
const { settings } = useSettings();
const form = useForm<InsurancePensionFormData>({ defaultValues });

// Use the form reset hook
const { resetWithData } = useFormReset({
  data: pension,
  form,
  apiToForm: (data) => insurancePensionToForm(data, settings.number_locale),
  defaultValues,
  dependencies: [settings.number_locale]
});
```

### Error Handling and Loading State Implementation

The Insurance Pension forms already use ErrorBoundary and LoadingState components, but they should be verified for consistency with the standardized pattern:

```tsx
// Add Form
<ErrorBoundary>
  <div className="container max-w-2xl mx-auto py-10">
    {/* Form content */}
  </div>
</ErrorBoundary>

// Edit Form
<ErrorBoundary>
  <div className="container py-10">
    {/* Header */}
    
    {/* Loading and error states */}
    {isLoading ? (
      <LoadingState message="Loading pension details..." />
    ) : error ? (
      <Alert variant="destructive">
        <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>
        <AlertDescription>{error.message}</AlertDescription>
      </Alert>
    ) : (
      <Form {...form}>
        {/* Form content */}
      </Form>
    )}
  </div>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Documentation Template

For each form section, document:

1. Layout structure
2. Explanation component
3. Formatting approach
4. Form reset implementation

This documentation will serve as a reference for implementing other pension types.

## üìã Form Layout Audit Results

The Insurance Pension forms are closest to the target implementation and should serve as the reference for other pension types.

### Current Structure

- **Form Sections**: 
  - Basic Information (name, provider, contract number)
  - Plan Details (start date, guaranteed interest, expected return)
  - Contribution Plan (multiple contribution steps with amounts and dates)
  - Statements (historical statements with projections)

- **Layout Pattern**:
  - Uses a single-column layout for mobile
  - Uses a partial grid layout for desktop, but not consistently
  - Some sections have explanations, but not in a standardized format

### Recommended Changes

- Implement consistent `FormLayout` and `FormSection` components
- Create dedicated explanation components for each section
- Ensure proper spacing between sections
- Standardize the responsive behavior

### Reference Implementation Notes

When implementing the standardized layout, use the following section structure:

```tsx
<FormLayout>
  <FormSection
    title="Basic Information"
    description="Enter the basic details of your insurance pension plan"
    explanation={<BasicInformationExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Basic information fields */}
  </FormSection>
  
  <FormSection
    title="Plan Details"
    description="Set up your insurance plan parameters"
    explanation={<PlanDetailsExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Plan details fields */}
  </FormSection>
  
  <FormSection
    title="Contribution Plan"
    description="Define your contribution schedule"
    explanation={<ContributionPlanExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Contribution plan fields */}
  </FormSection>
  
  <FormSection
    title="Statements"
    description="Record historical statements and projections"
    explanation={<StatementsExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Statements fields */}
  </FormSection>
</FormLayout>
```
