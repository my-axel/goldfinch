## üìã Overview & Goals

This plan focuses on verifying and finalizing the Insurance Pension forms as the reference implementation for other pension types. Since these forms are already closest to the target implementation, the focus is on verification and documentation rather than major changes.

### Key Goals
1. Verify that Insurance Pension forms follow the standardized patterns
2. Document these forms as reference implementations
3. Make any necessary adjustments to align with the standards

## üîç Implementation Details

### StatementsCard Implementation

The StatementsCard has been successfully updated to use standardized formatting components:

1. **Removed Custom Formatting Logic**:
   - Removed direct usage of `parseNumber`, `formatNumberInput`, `getDecimalSeparator`
   - Removed custom state management for formatted inputs
   - Removed custom input handlers and validation functions

2. **Replaced with Standardized Components**:
   - Used `CurrencyInput` for all currency fields (value, total_contributions, total_benefits, costs_amount, value_at_retirement, monthly_payout)
   - Used `PercentInput` for percentage fields (costs_percentage, return_rate)
   - Used `FormattedDate` for displaying dates

3. **Simplified the Code**:
   - Removed the complex `renderInput` function
   - Removed multiple state variables for tracking input values
   - Removed manual input validation and formatting
   - Simplified the form field rendering

4. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Standardized input behavior across all forms
   - Ensured proper hydration mismatch prevention
   - Maintained consistent formatting based on user locale settings

### ContributionDetailsCard Implementation

The ContributionDetailsCard has been successfully updated to use standardized formatting components:

1. **Removed Custom Formatting Logic**:
   - Removed direct usage of `parseNumber`, `formatNumberInput`, `getDecimalSeparator`
   - Removed custom state management for contribution inputs
   - Removed custom input validation function (`isValidNumberFormat`)
   - Eliminated the need for manual input state initialization

2. **Replaced with Standardized Components**:
   - Used `CurrencyInput` for amount fields
   - Continued using existing `DateInput` and `DateEndPicker` components which already follow best practices
   - Continued using `EnumSelect` for frequency selection which already follows best practices

3. **Simplified the Code**:
   - Removed complex state management for tracking input values
   - Eliminated manual input validation and formatting
   - Removed the need for useEffect to initialize input states
   - Simplified the form field rendering

4. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Standardized input behavior across all forms
   - Ensured proper hydration mismatch prevention
   - Maintained consistent formatting based on user locale settings

### Form Reset Implementation

```tsx
import { useFormReset } from '@/frontend/lib/hooks/useFormReset';
import { insurancePensionToForm } from '@/frontend/lib/transformers/insurancePensionTransformers';
import { useSettings } from '@/frontend/context/SettingsContext';

// Inside component
const { data: pension, isLoading, error } = usePensionData<InsurancePension>(pensionId, PensionType.INSURANCE);
const { settings } = useSettings();
const form = useForm<InsurancePensionFormData>({ defaultValues });

// Use the form reset hook
const { resetWithData } = useFormReset({
  data: pension,
  form,
  apiToForm: (data) => insurancePensionToForm(data, settings.number_locale),
  defaultValues,
  dependencies: [settings.number_locale]
});
```

### Error Handling and Loading State Implementation

The Insurance Pension forms already use ErrorBoundary and LoadingState components, but they should be verified for consistency with the standardized pattern:

```tsx
// Add Form
<ErrorBoundary>
  <div className="container max-w-2xl mx-auto py-10">
    {/* Form content */}
  </div>
</ErrorBoundary>

// Edit Form
<ErrorBoundary>
  <div className="container py-10">
    {/* Header */}
    
    {/* Loading and error states */}
    {isLoading ? (
      <LoadingState message="Loading pension details..." />
    ) : error ? (
      <Alert variant="destructive">
        <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>
        <AlertDescription>{error.message}</AlertDescription>
      </Alert>
    ) : (
      <Form {...form}>
        {/* Form content */}
      </Form>
    )}
  </div>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Documentation Template

For each form section, document:

1. Layout structure
2. Explanation component
3. Formatting approach
4. Form reset implementation

This documentation will serve as a reference for implementing other pension types.

## üìã Form Layout Audit Results

The Insurance Pension forms are closest to the target implementation and should serve as the reference for other pension types.

### Current Structure

- **Form Sections**: 
  - Basic Information (name, provider, contract number)
  - Plan Details (start date, guaranteed interest, expected return)
  - Contribution Plan (multiple contribution steps with amounts and dates)
  - Statements (historical statements with projections)

- **Layout Pattern**:
  - Uses a single-column layout for mobile
  - Uses a partial grid layout for desktop, but not consistently
  - Some sections have explanations, but not in a standardized format

### Recommended Changes

- Implement consistent `FormLayout` and `FormSection` components
- Create dedicated explanation components for each section
- Ensure proper spacing between sections
- Standardize the responsive behavior

### Reference Implementation Notes

When implementing the standardized layout, use the following section structure:

```tsx
<FormLayout>
  <FormSection
    title="Basic Information"
    description="Enter the basic details of your insurance pension plan"
    explanation={<BasicInformationExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Basic information fields */}
  </FormSection>
  
  <FormSection
    title="Plan Details"
    description="Set up your insurance plan parameters"
    explanation={<PlanDetailsExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Plan details fields */}
  </FormSection>
  
  <FormSection
    title="Contribution Plan"
    description="Define your contribution schedule"
    explanation={<ContributionPlanExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Contribution plan fields */}
  </FormSection>
  
  <FormSection
    title="Statements"
    description="Record historical statements and projections"
    explanation={<StatementsExplanation />}
  >
    {/* Statements fields */}
  </FormSection>
</FormLayout>
```
