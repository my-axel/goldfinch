> ## Working with These Documents
> 1. Read this index first to understand the overall approach
> 2. Follow the implementation plans in the specified order
> 3. Complete each plan before moving to the next

> ## AI Implementation Guidelines
> - Follow the implementation plans exactly as specified
> - Do not modify any code outside the scope of the plans
> - Create only the components and files mentioned in the plans
> - Use the provided code examples as templates
> - Implement one plan at a time in the specified order
> - Do not add features or functionality not described in the plans
> - Reference the Insurance Pension forms for any unclear details

## üìã Overview

This set of documents outlines a comprehensive plan for standardizing the pension forms across all pension types (ETF, Company, Insurance). The original comprehensive plan has been split into focused, manageable implementation plans to improve clarity and facilitate implementation.

### Key Goals
1. Standardize form layout using a flexible two-column grid pattern
2. Implement the `useFormReset` hook across all forms
3. Standardize number and date formatting using centralized utilities
4. Ensure consistent error handling and form architecture
5. Create reusable components to simplify implementation

## üìä Implementation Plans

The standardization has been divided into four focused implementation plans:

1. [**Layout Standardization**](01_layout_standardization.md)
   - Implement flexible two-column grid layout
   - Create reusable layout components
   - Ensure consistent spacing and responsive behavior

2. [**Formatting Standardization**](02_formatting_standardization.md)
   - Standardize number and currency formatting
   - Implement consistent date handling
   - Ensure proper hydration mismatch prevention

3. [**Form Reset Implementation**](03_form_reset_implementation.md)
   - Implement the `useFormReset` hook
   - Create type-safe transformers for each pension type
   - Eliminate manual reset logic in useEffect hooks

4. **Per-Pension Type Implementation**
   - [**Overview**](04_pension_type_implementation.md) - Implementation approach and order
   - [**Insurance Pension**](04a_insurance_pension_implementation.md) - Reference implementation
   - [**ETF Pension**](04b_etf_pension_implementation.md) - Highest priority
   - [**Company Pension**](04c_company_pension_implementation.md) - Medium priority

## üìã Implementation Order

The plans should be implemented in the order listed above, as each plan builds on the previous ones:

1. **Layout Standardization** (First)
   - No external dependencies
   - Creates the foundation for the other plans

2. **Formatting Standardization** (Second)
   - Works best after layout standardization
   - Focuses on consistent formatting patterns

3. **Form Reset Implementation** (Third)
   - Requires the form reset hook from [Form Reset Hook Implementation](docs/tech/refactoring/active/form_reset_hook.md)
   - Creates transformers for each pension type

4. **Per-Pension Type Implementation** (Fourth)
   - Requires completion of the first three plans
   - Start with Insurance Pension forms as reference
   - Then implement ETF Pension forms (highest priority)
   - Finally implement Company Pension forms (medium priority)

## üîç Reference Implementation

The Insurance Pension forms are closest to the target implementation and should serve as the reference for the other pension types. The implementation should proceed in this order:

1. Verify and finalize Insurance Pension forms as reference implementation
2. Apply standardization to ETF Pension forms (highest priority)
3. Apply standardization to Company Pension forms (medium priority)
